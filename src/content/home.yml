education:
  - name: The University of Texas at Austin
    sub: B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
    date: May 2021
    content: "My academic and personal projects reflect my interest in software
      development and commitment to pursuing software engineering as a primary
      technical core. I have taken courses pertaining to the following technical
      disciplines: Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, Embedded
      Systems, Circuit Theory, and Linear Systems and Signals."
work:
  - name: The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)
    sub: Secretary
    date: May 2019 - Present
    content: I currently hold the position of secretary for The Society of Hispanic
      Professional Engineers UT Chapter, but I have been involved in this
      organization since the start of my sophomore year. I previously held the
      position of Media Director during the Spring 2019 semester. As media
      director I oversaw a committee of members to market SHPE UT through our
      social media platforms, website, and newsletter. Currently as Secretary, I
      am in charge of organizing all of SHPE-UT’s file system, reporting member
      statistics to our national board, and managing three of our chair
      officers. However, the reason I am a leader in SHPE is because I enjoy
      serving my community of engineers at UT in any way I can. SHPE empowers me
      to help students who are struggling either emotionally or academically by
      connecting them to a network of others who are willing to be there for
      each other in times of need.
  - name: LAITS Student Technology Assistant
    sub: Project Management Student Technology Assistant
    date: August 2017 - Present
    content: I work within the UT College of Liberal Arts Instructional Technology
      Services department to assist project managers with organizing and editing
      recorded educational content for future publishing. I have held this
      position throughout college. Although my work does not involve any of the
      technical aspects of software development, the environment that I work in
      has helped teach me management skills through overseeing the creation and
      assignments of large scale projects.
